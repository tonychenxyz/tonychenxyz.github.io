  title={Interpreting and Controlling Vision Foundation Models via Text Explanations},
  author={Chen, Haozhe and Yang, Junfeng and Vondrick, Carl and Mao, Chengzhi},
  abstract={Large-scale pre-trained vision foundation models, such as CLIP, have become de facto backbones for various vision tasks. However, due to their black-box nature, understanding the underlying rules behind these models' predictions and controlling model behaviors have remained open challenges. We present a framework for interpreting vision transformer's latent tokens with natural language. Given a latent token, our framework retains its semantic information to the final layer using transformer's local operations and retrieves the closest text for explanation. Our approach enables understanding of model visual reasoning procedure without needing additional model training or data collection. Based on the obtained interpretations, our framework allows for model editing that controls model reasoning behaviors and improves model robustness against biases and spurious correlations. },
