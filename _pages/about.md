**Research**: I am interested in building interpretable, efficient, human-interaction-friendly AI models. My current research revolves around interpretable foundation models, differentiable simulation, emotional speech synthesis. At Columbia, I have the fortunate opportunities to work with [Chengzhi Mao](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcz/), [Carl Vondrick](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/), [Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/), and [Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/).

**Previously**: I was a quantitative research intern at [Voloridge](https://www.voloridge.com/), a quantitative hedge fund in Florida. I also enjoyed [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/tonychenxyz) for a while.
