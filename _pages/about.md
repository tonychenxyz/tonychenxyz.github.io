**Research**: I am interested shaping AI ecosystem as it becomes an increasingly pervasive part of our life and society. 

Currently, I am working on:
- Efficient inference and serving of foundation models
- Human-friendly, emotion-intelligent AI
- Personalized, adaptive evaluation of foundation models
- Interpretibility of large models

At Columbia, I have the fortunate opportunities to work with [Chengzhi Mao](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcz/), [Carl Vondrick](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/), [Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/), and [Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/).

I am also a research intern at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) working on accelerating inference.

I am looking for Fall 2025 PhD opportunities. Please feel free to contact me via [haozhe.chen@columbia.edu](mailto:haozhe.chen@columbia.edu)!

Find me on [X](https://x.com/tonychenxyz) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIy1aRQAAAAJ&hl=en).


**Previously**: I was a quantitative research intern at [Voloridge](https://www.voloridge.com/), a quantitative hedge fund in Florida. I also enjoyed [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/tonychenxyz) for a while.
