**Research:** My research goal is to build interpretable, efficient, human-interaction friendly AI models. My current research revolves around interpretable foundation models, differentiable simulation, emotional speech synthesis. At Columbia, I have the fortunate opportunities to work with [Chengzhi Mao](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcz/), [Carl Vondrick](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/), [Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/), and [Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/).
